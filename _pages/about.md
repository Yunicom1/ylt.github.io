Currently I am a second year PhD student of  Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and a member of [ASTAPLE](https://www.astaple.com/) Group.  
In June 2024, I received my B.Sc. degree from College of Automation Engineering in Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.  
I am very fortunate to be advised by  [Prof. YE Qingqing]([https://www.XXX.com/](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/dr-ye-qingqing/)).
